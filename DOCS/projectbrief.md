AI Architecture Planning Prompt for Stock Market Intelligence Platform
System Overview
You are architecting a SaaS platform for monitoring and analyzing Canadian small-cap stock market sentiment. The platform serves CEOs and founders of publicly traded companies who need real-time insights about their stock ticker's online presence and investor sentiment.
Core Architecture Components
1. Data Collection Layer
Primary Service: Firecrawl.dev
Purpose: Web scraping and content extraction
Target Sources:
- Twitter/X (Canadian FinTwit)
- CEO.ca forums
- Reddit (r/CanadianInvestor, r/Baystreetbets)
- Stockhouse.com
- YouTube (comments, transcripts)
- Discord servers (public investment channels)
- TMX Money
- Financial news sites

Data Types to Extract:
- Post content/comments
- Timestamp
- Author/username
- Engagement metrics (likes, shares, replies)
- Thread context
- Platform identifier
2. Data Storage Layer
Database: MongoDB
Collections Structure:
- raw_posts: Unprocessed scraped content
- processed_posts: Analyzed content with sentiment scores
- tickers: Company/ticker metadata
- alerts: Generated alerts and notifications
- analytics: Aggregated metrics and trends
- users: Platform users (CEOs/founders)

Schema Considerations:
- Time-series optimization for historical analysis
- Indexing strategy for ticker symbols and timestamps
- Sharding for scalability
3. AI Agent Framework (Agno.com)
Agent Architecture:
Agent 1: Content Classifier

Role: Initial content filtering and categorization
Tasks:

Identify ticker mentions
Filter spam/irrelevant content
Categorize content type (news, opinion, analysis, rumor)
Extract metadata



Agent 2: Sentiment Analyzer

Role: Deep sentiment analysis
Tasks:

Score sentiment (-1 to +1 scale)
Detect emotional indicators (panic, FOMO, enthusiasm)
Identify sentiment drivers (catalyst-based vs emotional)
Track sentiment velocity (rate of change)



Agent 3: Pattern Recognition

Role: Behavioral pattern identification
Tasks:

Detect unusual activity patterns
Identify coordinated behavior
Recognize pump/dump patterns
Track influencer impact



Agent 4: Risk Assessment

Role: Threat and opportunity detection
Tasks:

Flag potential crisis situations
Identify negative sentiment cascades
Detect misinformation spread
Score urgency levels



Agent 5: Insight Generator

Role: Create actionable intelligence
Tasks:

Generate executive summaries
Create trend reports
Produce recommendations
Build alert narratives



4. Processing Pipeline
Pipeline Flow:
1. Firecrawl scrapes content → 
2. Store in MongoDB (raw_posts) →
3. Content Classifier Agent processes →
4. Sentiment Analyzer Agent analyzes →
5. Pattern Recognition Agent identifies trends →
6. Risk Assessment Agent evaluates →
7. Insight Generator creates reports →
8. Store processed data in MongoDB →
9. Trigger alerts if thresholds met →
10. Update dashboard metrics
5. Dashboard Requirements
For CEOs/Founders:
- Real-time sentiment gauge
- Volume of mentions (24h, 7d, 30d)
- Top positive/negative posts
- Influencer mentions
- Peer comparison
- Alert feed
- Sentiment trend charts
- Platform breakdown
- Key discussion topics

MongoDB Schema Example

{
  _id: ObjectId,
  ticker: "XYZ",
  original_post: {
    content: "text",
    author: "username",
    platform: "twitter",
    url: "link",
    timestamp: ISODate,
    engagement: {
      likes: 0,
      shares: 0,
      replies: 0
    }
  },
  analysis: {
    sentiment_score: 0.75,
    confidence: 0.89,
    emotions: ["enthusiasm", "optimistic"],
    topics: ["earnings", "growth"],
    is_influencer: true,
    influencer_score: 8.5
  },
  alerts_triggered: ["positive_influencer_mention"],
